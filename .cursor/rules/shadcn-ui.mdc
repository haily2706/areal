# shadcn UI Component Guidelines

This project uses **shadcn ui** for all UI elements. The shadcn ui configuration is stored in [components.json](mdc:components.json).

## Initialization

If shadcn ui is not initialized in the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

If a particular component is not found in the project, use the following command to install it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

For example, to install the button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Component Location

All shadcn ui components are located in the `components/ui/` directory. When referencing or importing components, use the path alias `@/components/ui` as configured in [components.json](mdc:components.json).

## Best Practices

- Always use shadcn ui components instead of creating custom UI components from scratch
- Check if a component exists in `components/ui/` before adding it
- Follow the shadcn ui component patterns and styling conventions
- Components are configured with the "new-york" style and use TypeScript (TSX)
